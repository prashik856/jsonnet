Array and Object Comprehension
What if you want to make an array or object and you don't 
know how many elements / fields they will have at run-time? 

Jsonnet has Python-style array and object comprehension constructs to 
allow this.

Any nesting of for and if can be used.
The nest behaves like a loop nest, although the body is written first.


Below, a less contrived example. The first cocktail has equal parts of
 three ingredients. 
 
 The second iterates over an array of records - name prefix and fruit juice.

Try adding a "Red Screwdriver" with cranberry juice.
