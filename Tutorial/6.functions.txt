FUNCTIONS:
Like Python, functions have positional parameters, named parameters, 
and default arguments. 
Closures are also supported. 
The examples below should demonstrate the syntax. 
Many functions are already defined in the standard library.

Try writing a function is_even that uses the modulo operator % 
and returns either true or false.
