Jsonnet objects can be used like a std::map or similar datastructures 
from regular languages.

Recall that a field lookup can be computed with obj[e]
The definition equivalent is {[e]: ... }
self or object locals cannot be accessed when field names are 
being computed, since the object is not yet constructed.

If a field name evaluates to null during object construction, 
the field is omitted. 
This works nicely with the default false branch of a conditional (see below).

Try adding [self.f]: 'f' to see what happens, 
while pondering what that could even mean!
