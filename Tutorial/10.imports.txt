It's possible to import both code and raw data from other files.

- The import construct is like copy/pasting Jsonnet code.
- Files designed for import by convention end with .libsonnet
- Raw JSON can be imported this way too.
- The importstr construct is for verbatim UTF-8 text.

Usually, imported Jsonnet content is stashed in a top-level local variable. 
This resembles the way other programming languages handle modules. 
Jsonnet libraries typically return an object, so that they can easily 
be extended. 
Neither of these conventions are enforced.

Try including the Cosmopolitan from the library.

The following example shows how to write libraries of functions. 
It also shows how to define a local variable in the scope of a function. 
Try adding the Bee's Knees from above using the utility library.
