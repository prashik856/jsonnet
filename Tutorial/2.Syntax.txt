- Fields that happen to be valid identifiers have no quotes
- Trailing commas at the end of arrays / objects
- Comments
- String literals use " or '. The single quote is easier on the eyes but 
either can be used to avoid escaping the other, 
e.g. "Farmer's Gin" instead of 'Farmer\'s Gin'.
- Text blocks ||| allow verbatim text across multiple lines.
- Verbatim strings @'foo' and @"foo" are for single lines.
