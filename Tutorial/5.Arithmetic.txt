Arithmetic includes numeric operations like multiplication but 
also various operations on other types.

- Use floating point arithmetic, bitwise ops, boolean logic.
- Strings may be concatenated with +, which implicitly converts 
one operand to string if needed.
- Two strings can be compared with < (unicode codepoint order).
- Objects may be combined with + where the right-hand side wins field conflicts.
- Test if a field is in an object with in.
- == is deep value equality.
- Python-compatible string formatting is available via %. 
When combined with ||| this can be used for templating text files.
Try dividing by zero to see what happens.
