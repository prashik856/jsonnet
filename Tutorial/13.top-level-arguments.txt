Top-level arguments
Alternatively the same code can be written using top-level arguments, 
where the whole config is written as a function. 
How does this differ to using external variables?

- Values must be explicitly threaded through files
- Default values can be provided
- A config with top-level arguments can also be imported as a library 
and called as a function with parameters passed in

Generally, top-level arguments are the safer and easier way to 
parameterize an entire config, because the variables are not global 
and it's clear what parts of the config are dependent on their environment. 
However, they do require more explicit threading of the values into 
other imported code. 
Here's the equivalent invocation of the Jsonnet command-line tool:

jsonnet --tla-str prefix="Happy Hour " \
        --tla-code brunch=true ...

jsonnet 13.top-level-tla.jsonnet -o 13.top-level-tla.json --tla-str prefix="Happy Hour" --tla-code brunch=true
